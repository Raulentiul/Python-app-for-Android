ReLeaf is a phone app, created in Python language, where you can place events on a map, delete them and complete them for points (you can spend the points in the Award section of the app).

Me and my colleagues created this project during our first semester of faculty. In order to accomplish exporting the whole project on a phone, we had to use a linux tool called Buildozer. If you ever wanted to create a whole android app using python, I have an advice: don't :) .

Here you can download the app too on your phone:

(note that VariantaFinala is the final code, the rest are only betas!)
